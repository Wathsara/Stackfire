Once you install this and click on the icon to pop up, it will ask to enter the Stack Overflow userid. Make sure to enter the correct userid because it will ask only once. If you enter the wrong userid then you have to uninstall and install the extension in order to give the correct id again.

**You can find you userid in the top of your Stack Overflow account**

After that when you click on the icon, it will give the popup with 4 buttons.

**INBOX**
**Achievements**
**BADGES & REPUTATION**
**PROFILE INFORMATION**

The add-on is published and you can add it to your browser using the below link.
Link- https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/stackfire/?src=userprofile

You can use some stackexchange apis to get the profile information of the user.
Get the profile information - https://api.stackexchange.com/docs/users-by-ids
Get answers - https://api.stackexchange.com/docs/answers-on-users
Get questions - https://api.stackexchange.com/docs/questions-on-users


In the **PROFILE INFORMATION** tab it shows some of the details of the userid that you have provided. Some of those details are the profile picture, name, age, location, number of questions and answers you have provided. Actually as this add-on does not do any auth, it fetches the details of the profile using (except achievements and inbox) the userid that you have provided. So make sure to provide your id. If you provide some other id, then it will show the information of the owner of that particular id (no purpose for anyone). If you will accidently enter a wrong id and you want to change it, then you have to clear the browser cookies. So make sure to enter your correct ID.

In the **BADGES & REPUTATION** it shows the badges count as well as the reputation of the user. This is also fetched from the user id.

In the **INBOX** and **Achievements** tabs, your achievements and the inbox content is shown. https://stackoverflow.com/topbar/achievements and https://stackoverflow.com/topbar/inbox provides the achievements and the inbox of the user of the browser. So to fetch the data, the user needs to login to his or her Stackoverflow using the Firefox browser as these data gets fetched from the tabs.
